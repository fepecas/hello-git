# hello-git
Guys, come here to create your first branch, perform your first commit, push and pull request.

## first: solve at least one algorithm

_Let's use your preferred language in an online editor (e.g. playcode.io)_

0. Calculate the sum of the two given integer values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.
1. Get the absolute difference between n and 51. If n is greater than 51 return triple the absolute difference.
2. Check a given array (length will be at least 2) of integers and return true if there are two values 15, 15 next to each other.
3. Create a new array taking the elements after the element value 5 from a given array of integers.
4. Check if a given non-negative given number is a multiple of 3 or 7, but not both.
5. Reverse a given array of integers.
6. Check two given integers and return the value whichever value is nearest to 13 without going over. Return 0 if both numbers go over.
7. Calculate the sum of three integers. If one of the values is 13 then do not use it.
8. Check two given integers, each in the range 10..99. Return true if a digit appears in both numbers, such as the 3 in 13 and 33.
9. Given three integers, evaluate if "y" is greater than "x", and "z" is greater than "y".

The suggested file name looks like this:
**{your.name.surname}_algo##.ext**

A simple example is:
_andres.felipe.pena_algo01.js_

## second: name a small team (up to 5 members) and branch from master

The suggested branch name is lower case and uses hyphen to separate words:
**your-organization/team-name**

A simple branch name could be:
_sena-tolima/los-lechoneros_

## third: add your files, commit and push

From one or several computers, push these files to your team branch.

## fourth (and last): create your first PR

Once all the teams have new files in their branches, each of them must create a PR to bring those files to master branch. Let's try reviewing some of them by adding comments before merging.
